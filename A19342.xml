            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is, and hath beene an old prouerbe, that <hi>Birds of a feather hold and keep together,</hi> which hath euer beene a common cuſtome in theſe as much as in any other kinde whatſoeuer: but now the old prouerb is changed, and their cuſtome is altered cleane contrary.

            <p>We reade in the Hiſtories of our owne Countrie, that in the twelfth yeare of <hi>King

They fought ſo violent a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell among themſelues, that by eſtimation two parts of them were ſlaine, and fell to the ground: the number of thoſe which were killed, was ſo great, that they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp with ſhouels, and ſwept together with beſomes, that buſhels were filled with them, the third part hauing gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, flew away and vaniſhed, no man knew whither.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the fight of our birds, the Stares or Starlings, they muſtered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at this aboue-named Citie of <hi>Corke</hi> ſome foure of fiue daies, before they fought their battels, euery day more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing their armies with greater ſupplies, ſome came as from the Eaſt, others from the Weſt, and ſo accordingly they placed themſelues, and as it were encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they more curiouſly obſeruing the couſes and paſſages they vſed, noted that from thoſe on the Eaſt, and from thoſe on the Weſſ, ſundry flights, ſome twenty or thirty in a company, would paſſe from the one ſide to the other, as it ſhould ſeeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in embaſſages, for they would flye and houer in the ayre ouer the aduerſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with ſtrange tunes and noiſe, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe againe to that ſide from which as it ſeemed they were ſent.</p>
            <p>And further it was obſerued, that during the time they aſſembled, the Stares of the eaſt ſought their meare eaſtward, as the Stares of the weſt did the like weſtward, no one flying in the circuits of the other. Theſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19622:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->courſes and cuſtomes continued with them vntill the xij. of <hi>October,</hi> which day beeing <hi>Saturday,</hi> about nine of the clocke in the morning, being a very faire and Sun-ſhine day, vpon a ſtrange ſound and noiſe made as well on the one ſide as on the other, they forthwith at one inſtant tooke wing, and ſo mounting vp into the skyes, encountered one another, with ſuch a terrible ſhocke, as the ſound amazed the whole city and all the beholders. Vpon this ſodaine and fierce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, there fell downe into the citie, and into the Riuers, multitudes of Starelings or Stares, ſome with wings broken, ſome with legs and necks broken, ſome with eies pickt out, ſome their bils thruſt into the breſts &amp; ſides of their aduerſaries, in ſo ſtrange a manner, that it were incredible except it were confirmed by letters of credit, and by eye-witneſſes, with that aſſurance which is without all exception.</p>
            <p>Vpon the firſt encounter they withdrew themſelues backward eaſt and weſt, &amp; with

They continued this admirable and moſt violent battell till a little before night, at which time they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to vaniſh, ſo that all Sunday the xiij. of <hi>October</hi> none appeared about the Citie.</p>
            <p>Vpon this Sunday diuers paſſengers came out of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> who ſailing betwixt <hi>Graueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end</hi> and <hi>Wolwigge,</hi> they heard a loud and ſtrange noyſe and ſound in the aire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon caſting their eyes vpward, they ſaw infinite multitudes of Stares fighting in all violent manner together, with a Crow or Rauen flying betwixt them, for the flight being ſo high, they could not perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, whether it was Crow or Rauen: theſe birds had alſo ſeuerall encounters, making great ſound and noiſe, and euer as they diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and retired themſelues, the Crow or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen was ſeene in the middeſt. But what ſlaughter was made they could not obſerue

               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->becauſe the euening was ſomewhat darke and the battel was fought ouer woods more remote off, but for more aſſured proofe of this fight the Sunday before named, there are at this time in <hi>London</hi> diuers perſons of worth and very honeſt reputation, whom the Printer of this Pamphlet can produce to iuſtifie what they faw, as cauſe ſhall require, vpon their oaths.</p>
            <p>Now to returne to the laſt battell fought at Corke by theſe Stares. Vpon Munday the xiiij. of <hi>October,</hi> they made their returne againe, and at the ſame time, the day being as faire a Sun-ſhine day as it was the Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before, they mounted into the aire and encountred each other with like violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults as formerly they had done, and fell into the city vpon the houſes, and into the Riuer, wounded and ſlaughtered in like manner as before is reported: but at this laſt battell there was a Kite, a Rauen and a Crow all three found dead in the ſtreets, rent, torn and mangled.</p>

            <p>IN this precedent narration one report wil cauſe moſt admiration, and that is the Stares or Stare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings forbearing and abſenting themſelues from Corke vpon Sunday being the xiii. of October, ſhould that ſame day bee ſeene to fight neare or not farre off from Wolwige, whether the ſame Stares, it may bee held in reſpect of the diſtance of the place by ſea and land improbable: but this improbability is ſoone anſwered, for as the fight at Corke may ſeeme ſtrange and improbable, yet being moſt aſſured that ſuch a battle was fought, it may be as probable in the wonderfull workes of Almighty God, that notwithſtanding the diſtance of place, theſe may be the ſame Stares. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I wil diſpute theſe matters no further, ſithence in the workes of Almighty God, being contrary to the ordinary workes of his creation, all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which can be alle adged for them, is the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power of the Almighty Creator. As when contrary to ordinary courſe of Nature in the battell fought by Duke <hi>Ioſua,</hi> the Sunne ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his courſe the ſpace of a day. So when at the prayer of <hi>Ezechias</hi> the Sunne retired his courſe x. degrees: what other reaſon can be yeelded but the omnipotent power of Almighty God. So that albeit we ſhould not be curious to ſearch out rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the wonderfull workes of Almighty God, yerit doth import all Chriſtians not to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but that they muſt know and conſider there
